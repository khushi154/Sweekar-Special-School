        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Sweekar Special School caters to the individual needs of children from all sections of society. Our programme focuses on the holistic development of each child, tailoring support according to their unique needs and potential.Following a comprehensive assessment conducted by a team of special educators, psychologists, speech therapists, and occupational therapists, students are grouped thoughtfully based on their Chronological age, Mental age, Functional ability level.<br/> <br/>
        The individualized program for each child is developed with the support of a multidisciplinary team. Parents are equally involved in this process, and their input is given high priority while setting goals. Every three months, each child's progress is assessed, and based on their performance, short-term goals are planned for the next quarter.In this process, parents and teachers work as equal partners in setting goals for the Individualized Education Plan (IEP), which also includes addressing behavioral challenges and the vocational needs of the child.<br/><br/>
        At the school, a wide range of services is provided to support the holistic development of each child. These services include special education, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, individualized assessments, yoga, music and dance, communication services, NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) support, and vocational training, among others.
